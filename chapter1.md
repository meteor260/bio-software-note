# Toxtree

A approach using decision tree to classifier the structures as 3 class.

## Dataset

G.M. Cramer, R.A. Ford, and R.A. Hall, Estimation of toxic hazard â€“ a decision tree approach

I.C. Munro, R.A. Ford, E. Kennepohl, and J.G. Sprenger, Correlation of structural class with No-Observed-Effect Levels: A proposal for establishing a threshold of concern

## Algorithm

Using the 21 questions which declaim by Cramer as decision tree nodes.
