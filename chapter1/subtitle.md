#### Q1: Is the substance a normal constituent of the body, or an optical isomer of such?

This question throws into Class I all normal constituents of body tissues and fluids, including normal metabolites. Hormones are excluded, as are, by implication, the metabolites of environmental and food contaminants or those resulting from disease state.

**If YES, Class I; If NO, proceed to Q2**



#### Q2: Does the substance contain any of the following functional groups: an aliphatic secondary amine or a salt thereof, cyano, N-nitroso, diazo, triazeno or quaternary nitrogen, except in any of the following forms: 4C¼NþR2, 4C¼NþH2 or the hydrochloride or sulphate salt of a primary or tertiary amine?

Questions 2, 3 and 4 are a means of placing in Class III those structures that contain elements or valency states often associated with enhanced toxicity. Halo-, nitro-, N-nitroso- and diazocompounds, organophosphates, quaternary nitrogen compounds and similar xenobiotic structures should cause ‘yes’ answers to Question 2 and 3 and a ‘no’ answer to Question 4.

**If YES, Class III; If NO, proceed to Q3**



#### Q3: Does the structure contain elements other than C, H, O, N or divalent S?

**If YES, proceed to Q4; If NO, proceed to Q5**



#### Q4: Do all elements not listed in Q3 occur only as \(a\) a Na, K, Ca, Mg or ammonium salt of a carboxylic acid, or \(b\) a sulphate or hydrochloride of an amine, or \(c\) a Na, K, or Ca sulphonate, sulphamate or sulphate? \(If the answer is yes, treat as free acid, amine, unsulphonated or unsulphated compound, except for the purposes of Q24 and Q33, and proceed\).

This is intended to let through, for further consideration, certain acid, amine, sulphonate and sulphate salts. Sulphamate salts are treated as such because they are not readily hydrolysed.

**If YES, proceed to Q7; If NO, Class III**
