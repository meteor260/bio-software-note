#### Q1: Is the substance a normal constituent of the body, or an optical isomer of such?

This question throws into Class I all normal constituents of body tissues and fluids, including normal  
 metabolites. Hormones are excluded, as are, by implication, the metabolites of environmental and  
 food contaminants or those resulting from disease state.

**If YES, Class I; If NO, proceed to Q2**



#### Q2: Does the substance contain any of the following functional groups: an aliphatic secondary amine

or a salt thereof, cyano, N-nitroso, diazo, triazeno or quaternary nitrogen, except in any of the  
 following forms: 4C¼NþR2, 4C¼NþH2 or the hydrochloride or sulphate salt of a primary or  
 tertiary amine?

Questions 2, 3 and 4 are a means of placing in Class III those structures that contain elements or  
 valency states often associated with enhanced toxicity. Halo-, nitro-, N-nitroso- and diazocompounds,  
 organophosphates, quaternary nitrogen compounds and similar xenobiotic structures  
 should cause ‘yes’ answers to Question 2 and 3 and a ‘no’ answer to Question 4.

**If YES, Class III; If NO, proceed to Q3**



#### Q3: Does the structure contain elements other than C, H, O, N or divalent S?

**If YES, proceed to Q4; If NO, proceed to Q5**



#### Q4: Do all elements not listed in Q3 occur only as \(a\) a Na, K, Ca, Mg or ammonium salt of a

carboxylic acid, or \(b\) a sulphate or hydrochloride of an amine, or \(c\) a Na, K, or Ca sulphonate,  
 sulphamate or sulphate? \(If the answer is yes, treat as free acid, amine, unsulphonated or  
 unsulphated compound, except for the purposes of Q24 and Q33, and proceed\).

This is intended to let through, for further consideration, certain acid, amine, sulphonate and  
 sulphate salts. Sulphamate salts are treated as such because they are not readily hydrolysed.

**If YES, proceed to Q7; If NO, Class III**



#### Q5: Is it a simply branched acyclic aliphatic hydrocarbon or a common carbohydrate?

This drops out the generally innocuous hydrocarbons and carbohydrates.

**If YES, Class I; If NO, proceed to Q6**



#### Q6: Is the substance a benzene derivative bearing substituents consisting only of \(a\) hydrocarbon chains or 10-hydroxy or hydroxy ester-substituted hydrocarbon chains and \(b\) one or more alkoxy groups, one of which must be para to the hydrocarbon chain in \(a\)?

This places in Class III safrole, myristicin and related substances.

**If YES, Class III; If NO, proceed to Q7**



#### Q7: Is the substance heterocyclic

**If YES, proceed to Q8; If NO, proceed to Q16**



#### Q8: Is it a lactone or cyclic diester?

This question separates the lactones and cyclic diesters from other heterocyclic compounds.

**If YES, proceed to Q9; If NO, proceed to Q10**
