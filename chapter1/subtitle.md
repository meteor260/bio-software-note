## Q1: Is the substance a normal constituent of the body, or an optical isomer of such?

This question throws into Class I all normal constituents of body tissues and fluids, including normal  
 metabolites. Hormones are excluded, as are, by implication, the metabolites of environmental and  
 food contaminants or those resulting from disease state.

**If YES, Class I; If NO, proceed to Q2**

## Q2: Does the substance contain any of the following functional groups: an aliphatic secondary amine

or a salt thereof, cyano, N-nitroso, diazo, triazeno or quaternary nitrogen, except in any of the  
 following forms: 4C¼NþR2, 4C¼NþH2 or the hydrochloride or sulphate salt of a primary or  
 tertiary amine?

Questions 2, 3 and 4 are a means of placing in Class III those structures that contain elements or  
 valency states often associated with enhanced toxicity. Halo-, nitro-, N-nitroso- and diazocompounds,  
 organophosphates, quaternary nitrogen compounds and similar xenobiotic structures  
 should cause ‘yes’ answers to Question 2 and 3 and a ‘no’ answer to Question 4.

**If YES, Class III; If NO, proceed to Q3**

## Q3: Does the structure contain elements other than C, H, O, N or divalent S?

**If YES, proceed to Q4; If NO, proceed to Q5**

## Q4: Do all elements not listed in Q3 occur only as \(a\) a Na, K, Ca, Mg or ammonium salt of a

carboxylic acid, or \(b\) a sulphate or hydrochloride of an amine, or \(c\) a Na, K, or Ca sulphonate,  
 sulphamate or sulphate? \(If the answer is yes, treat as free acid, amine, unsulphonated or  
 unsulphated compound, except for the purposes of Q24 and Q33, and proceed\).

This is intended to let through, for further consideration, certain acid, amine, sulphonate and  
 sulphate salts. Sulphamate salts are treated as such because they are not readily hydrolysed.

**If YES, proceed to Q7; If NO, Class III**

## Q5: Is it a simply branched acyclic aliphatic hydrocarbon or a common carbohydrate?

This drops out the generally innocuous hydrocarbons and carbohydrates.

**If YES, Class I; If NO, proceed to Q6**

## Q6: Is the substance a benzene derivative bearing substituents consisting only of \(a\) hydrocarbon

chains or 10-hydroxy or hydroxy ester-substituted hydrocarbon chains and \(b\) one or more alkoxy  
 groups, one of which must be para to the hydrocarbon chain in \(a\)?

This places in Class III safrole, myristicin and related substances.

**If YES, Class III; If NO, proceed to Q7**

## Q7: Is the substance heterocyclic

**If YES, proceed to Q8; If NO, proceed to Q16**

## Q8: Is it a lactone or cyclic diester?

This question separates the lactones and cyclic diesters from other heterocyclic compounds.

**If YES, proceed to Q9; If NO, proceed to Q10**

## Q9: Is it a Lactone, fused to another ring, or 5- or 6-membered a,b-unsaturated lactone?

This places certain lactones known or suspected to be of unusual toxicity in Class III.

\*If it is a lactone, from this point on, treat the structure as if it were the hydroxy acid in the form of  
 its more stable tautomer and proceed to Q20 if it is open chain, to 10 if it is heterocyclic and to Q23 if  
 it is carbocylic; if it is a cyclic diester, treat as the separate components.

**If YES, Class III; If NO, \***

## Q10: Is it a 3-membered heterocycle?

This places such substances as epoxides and ethylenimine in Class III.

**If YES, Class III; If NO, proceed to Q11**

## Q11: Disregarding only the heteroatoms on any one ring, does that heterocyclic ring contain or bear

substituents other than simply branched hydrocarbons \(including bridged chains and monocyclic aryl  
 or alkyl structures\),alkyl alcohols, aldehydes, acetals, ketones, ketals, acids, esters \(including cyclic  
 esters other than lactones\), mercaptans, sulphides, methyl ethers, hydroxy or single rings \(hetero or  
 aryl\) with no substituents other than those just listed?

Questions 11–15 separate out various categories of heteroaromatic substances. Under 11, set aside  
 and do not consider the atom\(s\), usually O, N and S, making the ring heterocyclic. If there is more  
 than one hetero ring, regard each ring separately, with the remainder of the structure as substituents  
 of that hetero ring. Other than the heterocyclic atom\(s\), does the ring carry anything besides the simple groups listed?

If so, the answer is YES, and the next Question 33. If not, then classify further by Q12 et seq.  
 Bridged-chain derivatives may be represented by structures like the bicyclic ether 1,4-cineole while  
 monocyclic aryl derivatives may be represented by compounds like benzaldehyde propylene glycol  
 acetal or 3-phenyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde.

**If YES, proceed to Q33; If NO, proceed to Q12**

## Q12: Is it heteroaromatic?

This question separates the aromatic heterocyclics for the purpose of considering whether they are  
 polynuclear \(Q14\) or unsubstituted \(Q13\).

**If YES, proceed to Q13; If NO, proceed to Q22**

## Q13: Does the ring bear any substituents?

**If YES, proceed to Q14; If NO, Class III**

## Q14: Does the structure contain more than one aromatic ring?

**If YES, proceed to Q15; If NO, proceed to Q22**

## Q15: Is it readily hydrolysed to mononuclear residues? \(If YES, treat the mononuclear heterocyclic

residues by Q22 and any carbocyclic residue by Q16\).

**If YES, proceed to Q22; If NO, proceed to Q33**

## Q16: Is it a common terpene -hydrocarbon, -alcohol, -aldehyde or -carboxylic acid \(not a ketone\)?

Q16 and Q17 deal with terpenes. A hydrocarbon terpene that is a common terpene and has not  
 already been put in Class I by Q5, would go into Class I by Q16.

**If YES, Class I; If NO, proceed to Q17**

## Q17: Is the substance readily hydrolysed to a common terpene, -alcohol, -aldehyde or -carboxylic

acid? \(If the answer is YES, treat the hydrolysed residues separately and proceed to Q18 for the  
 terpene moiety and to Q19 for any non-terpenoid moiety\).

Since there may be substances that are hydrolysed to two or more residues, one of which is terpene,  
 treat the residues separately from Q18 onward to conclusion.

**If YES, proceed to Q18; If NO, proceed to Q19**

## Q18: Is the substance one of the following:

* a vicinal diketone; or a ketone or ketal of a ketone attached to a terminal vinyl group
* a secondary alcohol or ester of a secondary alcohol attached to a terminal vinyl group
* allyl alcohol or its acetal, ketal or ester derivative
* allyl mercaptan, an allyl sulphide, an allyl thioester or allyl amine
* acrolein, a methacrolein or their acetals
* acrylic or methacrylic acid
* an acetylenic compound
* an acyclic aliphatic ketone, ketal or ketoalcohol with no other functional groups and with  
   four or more carbons on either side of the keto group

* a substance in which the functional groups \(E\) are all sterically hindered

Q18 examines the terpenes \(and later the open-chain and mononuclear substances by reference\) to  
 determine whether they contain certain structural features generally thought to be associated with  
 some enhanced toxicity.

**If YES, Class II; If NO, Class I**

## Q19: Is the substance open chain?

Q19-21 deal with open-chain substances.

**If YES, proceed to Q20; If NO, proceed to Q23**

## Q20: Is the structure a linear or simply branched aliphatic compound, containing any one or

combination of only the following functional groups: \(a\) four or less, each, of alcohol, aldehyde,  
 carboxylic acid or esters and/or \(b\) one each of one or more of the following: acetal, either ketone  
 or ketal but not both, mercaptan, sulphide \(mono- or poly-\), thioester, polyoxyethylene  
 \[\(–OCH2CH2–\)x with x no greater than 4\], or primary or tertiary amine

This question should be answered YES if the structure contains one or any possible combination of  
 alcoholic, aldehydic or carboxylic acid or ester groups, provided there are no more than four of any  
 one kind. It should be answered YES if the structure contains in addition to, or instead of, those just  
 listed, any assortment of no more than one each of the following: acetal, either ketone or ketal but  
 not both, mercaptan, mono- or polysulphide, thioester, polyoxyethylene, primary or tertiary amine.  
 Answer the question NO if the structure contains more than four of any of the first set of groups,  
 more than one of the second set, or any substituent not listed.

**If YES, proceed to Q21; If NO, proceed to Q22**

## Q21: Does the structure contain 4¼ 3 different types of functional groups \(exclude methoxy and

consider acids and esters as one functional type\)?

Aliphatic compounds containing three or more different functional groups \(excluding methoxy\) are  
 too complex to permit satisfactory prediction of toxicity. They should go therefore, into Class III.  
 However, we do not wish to put into Class III polyesters and similar substances, so these and the  
 methoxy compounds get passed along to Q18.

**If YES, Class III; If NO, proceed to Q18**

## Q22: Is the substance a common component of food or structurally closed related to a common

component of food?

This question places in Class II the natural, nature-identical and nearly nature-identical substances  
 not already put into Class I by physiological occurrence or structural criteria. An artificial substance  
 or one not closely related, goes to Q33.

**If YES, Class II; If NO, proceed to Q33**

## Q23: Is the substance aromatic?

Questions 23-26 deal with alicyclic substances

**If YES, proceed to Q27; If NO, proceed to Q24**

## Q24: Is the substance monocarbocyclic \(excluding cyclopropane or cyclobutane and their

derivatives\) with ring or aliphatic side chains, unsubstituted or containing only alcohol,  
 aldehyde, side-chain ketone, acid, ester, or Na, K or Ca sulphonate or sulphamate, or acyclic  
 acetal or ketal?

**If YES, proceed to Q18; If NO, proceed to Q25**

## Q25: Is the substance \(a\) a cyclopropane or cyclobutane with only the substituents mentioned in Q24

or \(b\) a mono- or bicyclic sulphide or mercaptan?

**If YES, Class II; If NO, proceed to Q26**

## Q26: Does the structure contain no functional groups other than those listed in Q24 and is either

a monocycloalkanone or a bicyclic compound with or without a ring ketone?

**If YES, Class II; If NO, proceed to Q22**

## Q27: Do\(es\) the ring\(s\) have any substituents?

Questions 27–31 deal with aromatic compounds.

**If YES, Class III; If NO, proceed to Q28**

## Q28: Does the structure contain more than one aromatic ring?

**If YES, proceed to Q29; If NO, proceed to Q30  
**

## Q29: Is it readily hydrolysed to mononuclear residues? \(If YES, treat the individual aromatic

mononuclear residues by Q30 and any other residue by Q19\).

**If YES, proceed to Q30; If NO, proceed to Q33**

## Q30: Disregarding ring hydroxy or methoxy does the ring bear substituents other than 1-5-carbon

aliphatic groups, either hydrocarbon or containing alcohol, ketone, aldehyde, carboxyl or simple  
 esters that may be hydrolysed to ring substituents of 5 or less carbons? \(If a simple ester that may be  
 hydrolysed, treat the aromatic portion by Q18 and the residue by Q19\).

This should be answered NO if the ring bears only aliphatic groups of 5 carbons or less, which are  
 either hydrocarbon in nature or contain the groups listed. If the ring bears any other substituents  
 than those listed, the question should be answered YES and one should proceed to Q31.

**If YES, proceed to Q31; If NO, proceed to Q18**

## Q31: Is the substance an acyclic acetal, -ketal or -ester of any of the above substances \(see Q30\)?.

\(If YES, assume hydrolysis and treat the non-aromatic residues by Q19 and the aromatic residue  
 by Q18.\)

This question is simply designed to see whether the substance would fit within the definition of Q30 if  
 it were not an acetal, a ketal or an ester. In other words, would the substance carry only the groups  
 listed in Q30.

**If YES, proceed to Q18; If NO, proceed to Q32**

## Q32: Does the substance contain only the functional groups listed in Q30, or their derivatives

listed in Q31, but with any or all of the following: \(a\) a single fused non-aromatic carbocyclic  
 ring, \(b\) aliphatic substituent chains longer than 5 carbon atoms, or \(c\) a polyoxyethylene  
 \[\(–OCH2CH2–\)x, with x no greater than 4\] chain either on the aromatic ring or on an aliphatic side  
 chain?

Part \(a\) is intended to allow simple derivatives of tetralin into Class II while putting polycyclic  
 compounds such as steroids ultimately into Class III except those that may be normal food  
 components. Part \(b\) allows compounds with permitted functional groups but longer side chains into  
 Class II instead of sending them eventually into Class III. Part \(c\) puts short-chain polyoxyethylene  
 derivatives of aryl compounds into Class II rather than Class III.

**If YES, Class II; If NO, proceed to Q22**

## Q33: Does the substance bear on every major structural component at least one Na, K or Ca sulphonate or sulphamate for every 20 or fewer carbon atoms without any free primary amines  except those adjacent to the sulphonate or sulphamate.

Na, K, Ca sulphonate and sulphamate salts have a strong tendency to decrease toxicity by  
 promoting solubility and rapid excretion. This is particularly noticeable, for example, with some of  
 the food colourings. It is important that the substance bears sufficient sulphonate groups, including  
 one on each major structural fragments into which the original compound might be metabolised.  
 This question serves to steer sulphonated compounds except those with amines non-adjacent to the  
 sulphonate into a presumptively less toxic classification than the compounds would occupy if  
 unsulphonated.

**If YES, Class III; If NO, Class I**
