## Q1: Is the substance a normal constituent of the body, or an optical isomer of such?

This question throws into Class I all normal constituents of body tissues and fluids, including normal  
 metabolites. Hormones are excluded, as are, by implication, the metabolites of environmental and  
 food contaminants or those resulting from disease state.

**If YES, Class I; If NO, proceed to Q2**



## Q2: Does the substance contain any of the following functional groups: an aliphatic secondary amine

or a salt thereof, cyano, N-nitroso, diazo, triazeno or quaternary nitrogen, except in any of the  
 following forms: 4C¼NþR2, 4C¼NþH2 or the hydrochloride or sulphate salt of a primary or  
 tertiary amine?

Questions 2, 3 and 4 are a means of placing in Class III those structures that contain elements or  
 valency states often associated with enhanced toxicity. Halo-, nitro-, N-nitroso- and diazocompounds,  
 organophosphates, quaternary nitrogen compounds and similar xenobiotic structures  
 should cause ‘yes’ answers to Question 2 and 3 and a ‘no’ answer to Question 4.

**If YES, Class III; If NO, proceed to Q3**



## Q3: Does the structure contain elements other than C, H, O, N or divalent S?

**If YES, proceed to Q4; If NO, proceed to Q5**



## Q4: Do all elements not listed in Q3 occur only as \(a\) a Na, K, Ca, Mg or ammonium salt of a

carboxylic acid, or \(b\) a sulphate or hydrochloride of an amine, or \(c\) a Na, K, or Ca sulphonate,  
 sulphamate or sulphate? \(If the answer is yes, treat as free acid, amine, unsulphonated or  
 unsulphated compound, except for the purposes of Q24 and Q33, and proceed\).

This is intended to let through, for further consideration, certain acid, amine, sulphonate and  
 sulphate salts. Sulphamate salts are treated as such because they are not readily hydrolysed.

**If YES, proceed to Q7; If NO, Class III**



## Q5: Is it a simply branched acyclic aliphatic hydrocarbon or a common carbohydrate?

This drops out the generally innocuous hydrocarbons and carbohydrates.

**If YES, Class I; If NO, proceed to Q6**



## Q6: Is the substance a benzene derivative bearing substituents consisting only of \(a\) hydrocarbon

chains or 10-hydroxy or hydroxy ester-substituted hydrocarbon chains and \(b\) one or more alkoxy  
 groups, one of which must be para to the hydrocarbon chain in \(a\)?

This places in Class III safrole, myristicin and related substances.

**If YES, Class III; If NO, proceed to Q7**



## Q7: Is the substance heterocyclic

**If YES, proceed to Q8; If NO, proceed to Q16**



## Q8: Is it a lactone or cyclic diester?

This question separates the lactones and cyclic diesters from other heterocyclic compounds.

**If YES, proceed to Q9; If NO, proceed to Q10**



## Q9: Is it a Lactone, fused to another ring, or 5- or 6-membered a,b-unsaturated lactone?

This places certain lactones known or suspected to be of unusual toxicity in Class III.

\*If it is a lactone, from this point on, treat the structure as if it were the hydroxy acid in the form of its more stable tautomer and proceed to Q20 if it is open chain, to 10 if it is heterocyclic and to Q23 if it is carbocylic; if it is a cyclic diester, treat as the separate components.

**If YES, Class III; If NO, \***



## Q10: Is it a 3-membered heterocycle?

This places such substances as epoxides and ethylenimine in Class III.

**If YES, Class III; If NO, proceed to Q11**



## Q11: Disregarding only the heteroatoms on any one ring, does that heterocyclic ring contain or bear substituents other than simply branched hydrocarbons \(including bridged chains and monocyclic aryl or alkyl structures\),alkyl alcohols, aldehydes, acetals, ketones, ketals, acids, esters \(including cyclic esters other than lactones\), mercaptans, sulphides, methyl ethers, hydroxy or single rings \(hetero or aryl\) with no substituents other than those just listed?

Questions 11–15 separate out various categories of heteroaromatic substances. Under 11, set aside and do not consider the atom\(s\), usually O, N and S, making the ring heterocyclic. If there is more than one hetero ring, regard each ring separately, with the remainder of the structure as substituents of that hetero ring. Other than the heterocyclic atom\(s\), does the ring carry anything besides the simple groups listed?

If so, the answer is YES, and the next Question 33. If not, then classify further by Q12 et seq. Bridged-chain derivatives may be represented by structures like the bicyclic ether 1,4-cineole while monocyclic aryl derivatives may be represented by compounds like benzaldehyde propylene glycol acetal or 3-phenyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde.

**If YES, proceed to Q33; If NO, proceed to Q12**



## Q12: Is it heteroaromatic?

This question separates the aromatic heterocyclics for the purpose of considering whether they are polynuclear \(Q14\) or unsubstituted \(Q13\).

**If YES, proceed to Q13; If NO, proceed to Q22**



## Q13: Does the ring bear any substituents?

**If YES, proceed to Q14; If NO, Class III**



## Q14: Does the structure contain more than one aromatic ring?

**If YES, proceed to Q15; If NO, proceed to Q22**



## Q15: Is it readily hydrolysed to mononuclear residues? \(If YES, treat the mononuclear heterocyclic residues by Q22 and any carbocyclic residue by Q16\).

**If YES, proceed to Q22; If NO, proceed to Q33**



## Q16: Is it a common terpene -hydrocarbon, -alcohol, -aldehyde or -carboxylic acid \(not a ketone\)?

Q16 and Q17 deal with terpenes. A hydrocarbon terpene that is a common terpene and has not already been put in Class I by Q5, would go into Class I by Q16.

**If YES, Class I; If NO, proceed to Q17**
